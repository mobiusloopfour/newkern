# Install

To generate the build system, simply run the `configure` 
script. You will need:

  - ninja
  - cmake
  - xorriso (if you wish to use the iso generation script)
  - x86_64-elf-gcc
  - a posix compliant shell

All of these should be available in the repositories of
your linux distribution. x86_64-elf-gcc can also be found
on macOS using Homebrew or MacPorts.

To build, enter the newly created `build` directory and
type
  
  `ninja`

to generate the kernel .elf, which can be loaded by any
multiboot-compliant bootloader, or type

  `ninja iso`

to make an iso that will boot out of the box on non-uefi
systems. (The bootloader used is limine - see 
https://limine-bootloader.org/ - give them a star
on Github - https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine).
