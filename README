    NewKern is on track to be a 100% free and open 
source kernel. [1] To learn more, configure the build
system, and type help-`topic`. Example topics could be:

- `make help-arch`
- `make help-external-headers`

    Please keep in mind that the supplied documentation
might be outdated.

||                  BUILDING                  ||

    To configure your build, run

- `automake --add-missing`
- `autoreconf -fi`
- `./configure --host="<host>"`

    Currently only the  `i686-elf`  or   `i686-none-elf` 
host is supported.  You will need a cross compiler   for
the build. If you haven't already, install `i686-elf-gcc`
from your package manager, or build it   yourself.  You 
should do this before running autoreconf.
    All of this has been automated by running:

- `sh gen.sh`

After the configuration is finished, simply type:

- `make`
    
and the kernel will be build in the root directory.
It is a plain ELF file, which complies to multiboot 1.

To run, type:

- `make qemu`

This will launch an emulator running just the kernel.
